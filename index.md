## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of [Human-Centered Technologies for Learning at the Technical University of Munich](https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/hctl/startseite/). I hold a Dr. rer. nat. in Computer Science from the University of Tübingen, where I conducted my research at the Hector Research Institute of Education Sciences and Psychology and am a member of the LEAD Graduate School & Research Network. 

My dissertation focused on the multimodal assessment of attention-related processes during learning, combining machine learning with eye tracking, video, and physiological data.
In 2023, I completed a research stay at the Emotive Computing Lab (University of Colorado Boulder) with Prof. Sidney D’Mello, where I explored the generalizability of video-based mind wandering detection. I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science with a focus on Machine Learning and a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology, both from the University of Mannheim. During my studies, I worked at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES), the Chair of Macrosociology, and GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and research on education, with a focus on **multimodal machine learning to assess cognitive and behavioral processes during learning**. I develop AI-powered educational tools that integrate eye tracking, facial video, physiological signals, and text to model attention, engagement, and instructional quality and offer targeted, adaptive support.

Key topics include:

- Multimodal detection of aware and unaware mind wandering in online learning environments
- Adaptive, attention-aware learning technologies and real-time interventions
- Automated assessment of classroom dynamics and collaborative learning , such as hand-raising, gaze interaction and discourse quality
- AI literacy and human-centered LLM-based feedback systems for K-12 learners
